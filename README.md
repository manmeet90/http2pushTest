Hi fellow Web Developers,
I was thinking from a long time to write this article as I feel as a web developer(specially mobile web developer) it's very important to tackle performance related issues to grab more users in market like India and SE Asia where the internet speed is not that good compared to western world.
According to research done by Google few months back the next billion users who are going to be part of internet community will be from these markets only.
The average internet users in these markets have mostly of low or mid range devices in terms of internal Hardware, plus the mobile data cost in these countries are way higher for people to afford.Hence one can assume the user won't have always the mobile data enabled.
On top of over the users in these regions have max 3G connection which makes it more serious for us as a web developer.
Thus creating web applications to grab user in these markets requires some extra efforts on performance side to make sure user doesn't come back to your website next time.So how one can achieve such user experience.

The Current state of mobile Web:

According to one of the study currently the average loading time of mobile web apps is on an average 19seconds!!
This a hell lot of time considering the another study where it was found that a typical user leaves your website and never vists again if it takes more than 2 seconds to load on desktop or 5 seconds to load on mobile.
Fortunately the Web development world is changing fast and most importantly in a right direction.
